This project includes a downloadable .json file that contains the complete structure of the AI agent workflow built on n8n Cloud. This file can be imported directly into any n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted) to replicate the full functionality of the chatbot, including the Google Gemini integration, memory handling, and SerpAPI for web searches. By including the JSON file in this repository, the workflow is fully reproducible, shareable, and ready to be extended or customized as needed.
